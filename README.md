# EmbeddedMotionControl
Autonomous robotic control

This is a personal project based on the course 'Mobile Robot Control' with course ID 4SC020 from the TU/e and the code was written in colaboration with 5 other project members. To get a better understanding of the subjects created by the other team members I wanted to recreate the projected on my own. The goal of this project is to create a functional autonomous robot that, given an static layout of the map, locate itself within the environment and drive between (pre)defined locations without bumping into static and dynamic objects. The project will be written in C++ and works on top of a ROS layer and created for the Gostai Jazz robot (https://www.robotshop.com/media/files/pdf/gostai-jazz-information-sheet.pdf).

If you have a remark, tip or question about the project when came across this page, contact me @ gbennie996[at]gmail[dot]com. Simulation files from TU/e will not be provided and will not be shared!
